# ✅ **COMPLETE VOTE SYSTEM FIXED - POST & COMMENT VOTING!**

## 🚨 **Problems Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue 1**: POST /api/posts/28/vote - 404 Error
```
❌ POST http://localhost:3001/api/posts/28/vote 404 (Not Found)
```
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/posts/:id/vote` but I only had `/api/posts/:postId/vote/:userId`

### **Issue 2**: Comment Voting Not Functional
```
❌ Comment upvote/downvote buttons not working
❌ No comment voting endpoints existed
```

}
```
