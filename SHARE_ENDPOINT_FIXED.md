# ✅ **SHARE ENDPOINT 404 ERROR FIXED!**

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

You were getting this 404 error:
```
❌ POST http://localhost:3001/api/posts/28/share 404 (Not Found)
❌ Frontend share button not working
```

**Root Cause**: Frontend was calling `/api/posts/:id/share` (without 's') but I only had `/api/posts/:id/shares` (with 's')

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

**Added the missing endpoint that matches exactly what your frontend is calling:**

```javascript
// NEW: Frontend-compatible share endpoint
POST /api/posts/:id/share
Headers: { 'x-user-id': '1' }

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "Post shared successfully",
  "data": {
    "share_count": 10
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Confirmed - ALL WORKING**

```
🧪 Testing share endpoint that was causing 404...

1. Testing POST /api/posts/1/share (frontend format)...
   Status: 200 ✅
   ✅ SUCCESS: Post shared successfully
   Share count: 10

2. Testing POST /api/posts/1/shares (original format)...
   Status: 200 ✅
